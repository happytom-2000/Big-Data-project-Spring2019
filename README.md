NYU CS-GY 6513: Big Data project "Antarctica: The Last Frontier"

The goal of this project was to combine and analyze different data sets about Antarctic bedrock/ice levels and general population density, to eventually predict when rising temperatures would expose bedrock in Antarctica, and where/how densely people would be able to settle.

My contribution shown in repository included PySpark code utilizing linear regression to determine ice levels at varying time points in the future, followed by format conversion to pandas for plotting of the linear models. In addition, I and collaborator Meghan Bongartz used ArcGIS (shown in the report) to visualize these DataFrames onto Antarctic geographic image mosaic data.
